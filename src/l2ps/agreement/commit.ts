/**
 * Commit an accepted negotiation into a WI-D `AgreementDocument`.

 * Nothing took it to the thing the parties are actually bound by — the
 * committed agreement. This is that step, and it is where the SR-4 brief's §0
 * invariant is made structural rather than aspirational: the document's parties
 * ARE the channel's members, and the terms ARE the ones this session accepted,
 * so the identity that signed in-channel is necessarily the identity that
 * co-signs the commitment.
 *
 * The RFQ/session surfaces are structural (mirroring `finalize.ts`) so this
 * composes with anything that reports the same shape.
