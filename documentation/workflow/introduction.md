# Introduction Demos Work

This is a new way

Demos Work is built on these 2 things:

1. Work Steps
2. Operations

### 1. Work Steps

A work step can either be a web2, xm or a native transaction. Say for example, sending tokens on Ethereum or calling a web2 API.

### 2. Operations

An operation controls the execution of work steps. For example, you can have an operation to send a xm transaction based on some condition.

Operations in a work script are ordered using an ordered list of operation ids.
