# Type Definitions
- `src/types/` organizes declarations by domain: `blockchain/` (transaction payloads, chain enums), `bridge/` (operation schemas), `demoswork/`, `instantMessaging/`, `web2/`, etc.
- `src/types/index.ts` aggregates exports for SDK consumers; check this tree to understand structured payload contracts.
